# torus
Interactive Text Torus made using javascript library p5js webGL. I started working with p5js as a "beginner's training" before jumping into openframeworks since I know JavaScript but not c++. This exercise started as a 3D torus with a text texture, and later on added the interactivity by creating an input that would print every key typed into the text array that works as a texture.
